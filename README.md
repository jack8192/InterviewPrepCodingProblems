InterviewPrepPrograms
=====================

Various coding problems and sample solutions, written in C, for use in prepping for job interviews.

This repository contains several programming problems that you might be asked to solve during a
job interview.  These questions are representative of what might be asked in an INITIAL
technical interview.

The module for each problem can be programmed in a half-hour, more or less.
In general, the module's testbench took longer to code than the module itself!
Note.  These testbenches are a simple testing environment, as are the coding problems.

Instructions on how to use these materials:

  a. The modules are structured in a Test Driven Development (TDD) style.
     First read the X_testbench.c module in its entirety, and then write
     the code for X.c that is called by its corresponding testbench.

  b. write the code for each X.c on your own
     take your time and review C syntax and coding practices
     use the testbench to verify your answer

  c. compare your code to the sample answer
     Hopefully, your code will be MORE comprehensive
     than the provided solution.

  d. These sample programs were compiled within the lcc-win32 editor and compiler GUI.
     Results may vary if compiled using other c-compilers.


Problems are:

  IsPal.c       :: determine if a string is a palindrome

  LevelnNodes.c :: print only nodes at level n of a binary tree

  BizzFizz.c    :: A simple use of mod and printf.   This problem
                   is also an excercise for Codeacademy.com and has
                   been used as an interview question by other software
                   vendors.

  Fibonocci.c   :: Determine the n'th integer in a Fibonocci sequence.
                   Do NOT use the closed form equation to determine the
                   nth value of this sequence.
